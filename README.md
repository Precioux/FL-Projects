# Project 1: DFA, NFA, and Regular Expression Converters

This repository contains the implementation of Project 1 for the Fundamentals of Languages and Machines course. Project 1 is divided into three parts, each addressing different aspects of automata theory and regular languages. Below is a brief overview of each part:

Part 1: DFA Acceptor
---------------------
In this part, we implement a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) acceptor. The goal is to create a program that can determine whether a given string is accepted by a given DFA. The implementation should take into account the transitions and accepting states of the DFA, and based on those, decide whether the input string is accepted or rejected.

Part 2: NFA to DFA Converter
---------------------------
In this part, we focus on converting NFAs (Nondeterministic Finite Automata) to DFAs. The program should be able to read an NFA and produce an equivalent DFA. This conversion is important as it simplifies the automaton and allows for efficient pattern matching and language recognition. The implementation should handle the nondeterministic nature of the input NFA and create a deterministic version of it.

Part 3: Regular Expression to NFA Converter
------------------------------------------
In this part, we explore the conversion of regular expressions to NFAs (Nondeterministic Finite Automata). Regular expressions are widely used for pattern matching, and the ability to convert them into automata enables efficient text processing and parsing. The program should take a regular expression as input and generate an NFA that recognizes the same language.

# Project 2: Turing Machine for (3n+1)!
---------------------------------------
This repository also includes the implementation of Project 2, which focuses on Turing machines. The goal is to create a Turing machine that can compute the factorial of (3n+1), where 'n' is a non-negative integer. The program should take 'n' as input and produce the result of (3n+1)! using the capabilities of a Turing machine.
